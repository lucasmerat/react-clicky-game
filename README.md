## Description

*React Cartoon Memory Game* is a simple, fun matching game, built with React. To play, try and click every character in a row without clicking the same one twice. 

This app was created for week 16 of UT Austin coding bootcamp. This unit we learned react and were practicing using both functional and class-based components. This first assignment had us get our feet wet with state management and passing data between components using props.
